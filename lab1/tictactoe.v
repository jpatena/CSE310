// Tic-tac-toe

// TicTacToe
// Generates a move for X in the game of tic-tac-toe
// Inputs:
//   xin, oin - (9-bit) current positions of X and O.
// Out:
//   xout - (9-bit) one hot position of next X.
//
// Inputs and outputs use a board mapping of:
//
//   0 | 1 | 2 
//  ---+---+---
//   3 | 4 | 5 
//  ---+---+---
//   6 | 7 | 8 
//
// The top-level circuit instantiates strategy modules that each generate
// a move according to their strategy and a selector module that selects
// the highest-priority strategy module with a move.
//
// The win strategy module picks a space that will win the game if any exists.
//
// The block strategy module picks a space that will block the opponent
// from winning.
//
// The empty strategy module picks the first open space - using a particular
// ordering of the board.
